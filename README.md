# Rock_Paper_Scissors

## Project Description:

This project was created as part of The Odin Project course. I have built the project fully by myself starting from scratch.

The aim of this project is to have fun with the game and play some Rock Paper Scissors against the computer

The game is hosted with github pages and you can visit it via this link: https://bencej98.github.io/Rock_Paper_Scissors/

## Tech Stack:

JavaScript\
HTML\
CSS

## Usage:

The usage of the game is fairly simple. When you arrive to the page you will three buttons where you can make a choice of rock, paper or scissors.


## Playing a round:

You simply have to click any of the three buttons. After clicking it the clicked button becomes your choice for that round. The computer will also randomly choose and based on it's choice the algorithm will decide the winner.\
\
You will see the result of the current round in the "Results" box. The current scores are display in the "Player scores" and in the "Computer scores" boxes.

## Structure of the game:

For the creation if this game I used vanilla JavaScript to learn every bit of the language before using any framework.

Other than that I created the style and structure of it using HTML and CSS.

## Future development:

I think the styling of the page is fairly minimal so that could have some improvement in the future.

## Struggles/Summary:

This project was my first one using Vanilla JavaScript. Because of this I needed to learn a lot of concepts from documents which I fairly enjoyed. I believe I have acquired a lot of knowledge from the creation of this project.
